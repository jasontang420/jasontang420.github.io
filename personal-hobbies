<p>Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen baby
Team 10
Los Angeles, Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio though, white boy

[Verse 1: Jake Paul]
It's everyday bro, with the Disney Channel flow. 5 mill on YouTube in 6 months, never done before.. Passed all the competition man, PewDiePie is next. Man I'm poppin' all these checks, got a brand new Rolex. And I met a Lambo too and I'm coming with the crew. This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?. And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew. Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention. Talking shit on Twitter too but you still hit my phone last night. It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove and all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth. And I just dropped some new merch and it's selling like a god, church. Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum. We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun. I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one. I cannot be outdone, Jake Paul is number one. It's everyday bro. It's everyday bro. It's everyday bro. I said it is everyday bro!</p>
